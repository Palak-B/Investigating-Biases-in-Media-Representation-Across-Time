# Investigating-Biases-in-Media-Representation-Across-Time
1 Research Question
This project will examine whether newer media exhibit fewer biases, in terms of gender and race, compared
to older media. We will analyze this through the language in various sources of media including fictional
works, news articles, magazines and non-fictional works across different time periods, particularly before
and after 2000. We aim to quantify changes in biases over time by making use of word embeddings that
can effectively capture the properties of language, and thereby, assess if inclusivity decrease or increase is
reflected in media language over time.
Recent research has focused on quantifying bias in language using metrics that make use of word em-
beddings. Intrinsic metrics analyze embeddings to measure inherent bias statistically, i.e establish bias
through geometric relations between different words.
Through a literature review, weâ€™ve identified high-quality datasets and established promising bias evalu-
ation metrics. Our methodological approach ensures a rigorous investigation of biases in media represen-
tation across time. Our evaluation will encompass a comprehensive set of metrics and analyze the results
through visualizations.
